Sketch 2 for Coding for Digital Storytelling: An interactive application for people to further delve into the political affiliations of 21st century supreme court justices

## Tech Stack
Created with Vite, React with TypeScript, and TailwindCSS. 

To run locally, clone the repo with node version 16 or higher, run `yarn install` to install dependencies, and `yarn dev` to run the application at localhost:5173.

### Reflection
First time using TailwindCSS. I really like some of the shorthand that Tailwind provides. However, I am a bit wary of the reusability of styles and styles with dynamic values. I could imagine using it in smaller projects like this, but not at scale. 

This is the first time I have used Vite over another bundler system like Create-React-App. Some people have been pushing to remove CRA from the react documentation as the recommended way to start a react project, due to the fact that it is very outdated. It doesnt have TS support built in, and the hot reload during development can be a bit slow. Vite is a modern replacement that has gotten a lot of buzz, and developing with it has been pretty seamless! Any change I've made locally was almost immediately updated. 

There are so many JS frameworks, it is difficult to keep track of it all. So, small projects like these are great places to experiment and gain insight into the nuances of modern web development trends.
